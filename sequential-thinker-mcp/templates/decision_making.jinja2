## DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK

Follow this systematic approach to analyze the decision:

### STEP 1: Define the Decision
**Objective:** Clearly articulate what decision needs to be made and why it's important.

**Analysis:**
- What exactly needs to be decided?
- What is the underlying problem or opportunity?
- Who are the key stakeholders affected?
- What is the timeline for this decision?

**Output:** Clear problem statement and decision scope

---

### STEP 2: Identify Decision Criteria
**Objective:** Establish the factors that matter most for this decision.

{% if criteria %}
**Given Criteria:**
{% for criterion in criteria %}
- {{ criterion }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

**Analysis:**
- What outcomes do we want to achieve?
- What constraints must we respect?
- How should we weight different factors?
- What are the key success metrics?

**Output:** Prioritized list of decision criteria with relative importance

---

### STEP 3: Generate Alternatives
**Objective:** Identify all viable options for this decision.

{% if alternatives %}
**Given Alternatives:**
{% for alternative in alternatives %}
- {{ alternative }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

**Analysis:**
- What are all the possible approaches?
- Are there creative combinations of options?
- What alternatives might others suggest?
- Have we considered the "do nothing" option?

**Output:** Comprehensive list of decision alternatives

---

### STEP 4: Evaluate Each Alternative
**Objective:** Assess how well each option meets our criteria.

**Analysis:**
For each alternative, evaluate:
- How well does it meet each criterion?
- What are the potential risks and benefits?
- What resources would be required?
- What could go wrong (risk analysis)?
- What are the short-term vs. long-term implications?

**Output:** Detailed evaluation matrix comparing alternatives against criteria

---

### STEP 5: Consider Implementation
**Objective:** Think through the practical aspects of executing each option.

**Analysis:**
- What would implementation look like for each option?
- What resources, skills, or support would be needed?
- What are the potential obstacles?
- How reversible is each decision?
- What would be the first steps?

**Output:** Implementation feasibility assessment for top alternatives

---

### STEP 6: Make the Decision
**Objective:** Select the best alternative based on the analysis.

**Analysis:**
- Which alternative best satisfies our most important criteria?
- Which option offers the best balance of benefits vs. risks?
- Which decision aligns best with our values and constraints?
- What does our intuition tell us after this systematic analysis?

**Output:** Clear decision with reasoning

---

### STEP 7: Plan Next Steps
**Objective:** Outline immediate actions to move forward.

**Analysis:**
- What are the first 3-5 actions needed?
- Who needs to be informed of this decision?
- How will we monitor progress and results?
- What contingency plans should we have?
- When should we review this decision?

**Output:** Action plan with timeline and responsibilities

## CONSTRAINTS TO CONSIDER
{% for constraint in constraints %}
